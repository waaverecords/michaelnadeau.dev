## The Contest: "Équipe sur la coche"

Our company, CDID, hosted a contest where teams were challenged to showcase their unique qualities through a creative presentation. The goal? To introduce each team in a way that highlights what makes them stand out. The format was open-ended—anything from photos to videos to theatrical performances. The winning team would receive a budget boost for team activities, making the competition even more exciting!

## Who We Are

We are part of the R&D, infrastructure, and special projects team—constantly innovating and pushing boundaries. Our team thrives on tackling complex problems, finding creative solutions, and leveraging technology to enhance our work.

## The Making of Our Video

Creating our video was an incredible journey that took approximately 50–60 hours of work. We poured our creativity, technical expertise, and passion into every frame. Here’s what went into it:

### 1. Tools and Software

To bring our vision to life, we used:

- **[DaVinci Resolve](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/ca/products/davinciresolve)** – For high-quality video editing and color grading.
- **[Blender](https://www.blender.org/)** – To create stunning 3D animations and visual effects.
- **[Photoshop](https://www.adobe.com/ca/products/photoshop.html)** – For designing assets and refining visuals.
- **[Suno AI](https://suno.com/home)** – To generate custom music that perfectly matched the tone of our video.

### 2. Learning and Challenges

Throughout this process, we expanded our skills, particularly in 3D modeling and animation with Blender. Each team member contributed their expertise, whether in scripting, animation or editing. The biggest challenge? Coordinating all elements to create a cohesive, engaging final product.
